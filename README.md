## üöÄ Installation

To get started with the AutoML Streamlit App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automl-streamlit-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd automl-streamlit-app
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn joblib
   ```

   Alternatively, you can create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   streamlit
   pandas
   scikit-learn
   joblib
   ```
   Then install the requirements using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

These packages are necessary for running the AutoML Streamlit App:
- `streamlit`: For creating the web application interface
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning models and utilities
- `joblib`: For model serialization and deserialization

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

To run the AutoML Streamlit App:

1. Ensure you're in the project directory and your virtual environment is activated (if you created one).

2. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to access the app.

4. Follow the intuitive interface to upload your data, perform transformations, train models, and export the results.

## ü§ñ Models

The AutoML Streamlit App supports the following machine learning models:

- Decision Tree Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Linear Regression (for continuous target variables)
